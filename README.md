# Rutgers Bootcamp Project One 

In this assignment, our team performed analyses on data related to the atheltes of the Summer and Winter Olympics, from  1896-2016. Using this comprehensive .csv file, we created visualizations which helped us to understand these athletes and games a little better, and answer questions related to events, seasonality, and athletes' age. 

# Description

We found our data on kaggle.com after determining we would like to perform analysis on some sort of sports data, which we narrowed down to data on the Olympic games specifically. The dataset we used can be found at:


   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results

   
   We also checked some data points against data from Olympics.com to ensure accuracy

   
Latitude and longitude data was found on Google for further analysis


Using python and panda libraries such as Matplotlib and Scipy, we created several visualizations that allowed us to answer questions about the Olympic games and the athletes who compete in them.

Some conclusions made are:
   Across all sports, the most popular (athletics, gymnastics, etc) have had several thousand participants, while the least popular have had as few as one.
   The "optimal" ages to compete in the Olympics, with the goal of receiving a medal, is ages 23-28, as this group has by far the most medals of any age group.
   The distribution of age among medalers varies more among women than it does men
   

# Project Summary

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Hint: Check out the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb located in the .zip file to review the desired format for this assignment.

# Dependencies

* Must have Anacondas installed installed to use Jupyter Notebooks

* Can use have Visual Studio Code to check code 

# Installing

* Use Resources files to use code 
* No modifications needed to be made to files/folders

# Help

No issues as it runs well on Microsoft Excel. Do recommend erasing the updated data to check the code every time.
